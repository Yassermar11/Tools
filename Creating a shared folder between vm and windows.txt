Step 1: Set Up a Shared Folder on Windows
1) Create a Folder on Windows that you want to share.
   For example, create a folder named SharedFolder

2) Right-click on the folder, and select Properties.

3) Go to the Sharing tab and click on Advanced Sharing.

4) In the Advanced Sharing window:

   - Check Share this folder.
   - You can give the folder a name (e.g., SharedFolder) to make it easier to access from Ubuntu.
   - Click Permissions, and ensure that Full Control is enabled for everyone (or for specific users).
5) Click OK to apply the changes.
6) Note the Network Path for the folder (Network path is usually like that \\YourWindowsPC\SharedFolder we will use it in this way YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/SharedFolder).

Step 2: Install Samba on Ubuntu

$ sudo apt install samba smbclient cifs-utils

Step 3: Access Windows Shared Folder from Ubuntu
Now, you'll mount the Windows shared folder on Ubuntu so you can access it as if it were a local directory.

Create a mount point for the shared folder on Ubuntu: 
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/shared_folder

network path: //192.192.192.192/SharedFolder
mount point for the shared folder : /mnt/shared_folder
your username: user (use "echo %USERNAME%" in cmd if you don't know it)
your password: pass1234 (This password is either the local Windows account password or Microsoft account password (if you're using a Microsoft account))


Mount the shared folder: 
$ sudo mount -t cifs //192.192.192.192/SharedFolder /mnt/shared_folder -o username=user,password=pass1234,uid=$(id -u),gid=$(id -g),file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777



If you want the shared folder to be mounted automatically on system boot:

type this commande to extract only the uid and gid from the /etc/passwd file for your username
change ubuntu with the name of your linux machine

$ awk -F: '/ubuntu/ {print $3, $4}' /etc/passwd
output : 1000 1000

Then, open this file

$sudo nano /etc/fstab

And add this line to the end of the file
Change it with the information according to you
//192.168.100.1/SharedFolderForVMs  /mnt/shared_folder cifs username=user,password=pass1234,uid=1000,gid=1000,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0


These steps will allow you to share a folder from your Windows machine and access it from Ubuntu, both manually and automatically on boot.


Step 1: Set Up a Shared Folder on Windows
Create a folder
Access Folder Properties
- Right-click the folder and select Properties.
- Navigate to the Sharing tab and click on Advanced Sharing.
- Check the box for Share this folder.
- Click Permissions, and ensure Full Control is enabled for "Everyone" (or for specific users you want to grant access to).
- Click OK to save the settings.
- Note the Network Path:

Take note of the network path, which will be something like \\YourWindowsPC\SharedFolder.
We will use it in this way 192.168.100.1/SharedFolder as the network path.(with 192.168.100.1 is the ip @ of the Windows machine)

Step 2: Install Samba on Ubuntu

$ sudo apt install samba smbclient cifs-utils

Step 3: Mount the Shared Folder on Ubuntu

First, create a directory on Ubuntu where the shared folder will be mounted:
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/shared_folder

Use the following command to mount the shared folder from Windows to Ubuntu

network path: //192.192.192.192/SharedFolder
mount point for the shared folder : /mnt/shared_folder
your username: user (use "echo %USERNAME%" in cmd if you don't know it)
your password: pass1234 (This password is either the local Windows account password or Microsoft account password (if you're using a Microsoft account))

$ sudo mount -t cifs //192.168.100.1/SharedFolder /mnt/shared_folder -o username=user,password=pass1234,uid=$(id -u),gid=$(id -g),file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777

And try now to access to /mnt/shared_forder and see if you can see the folders/files shared, and add and delete this, and check if all this operation appear on the folder in the Windows machine

Step 4: Auto-Mount the Shared Folder on Boot (Optional)
To have the shared folder automatically mount when your system starts:

Run the following command to extract the uid and gid for your user:

$ awk -F: '/ubuntu/ {print $3, $4}' /etc/passwd
Replace ubuntu with your actual username, and note the output (e.g., 1000 1000).

Edit the fstab File:

$ sudo nano /etc/fstab

At the end of the file, add the following line to automatically mount the shared folder on boot:

//192.168.100.1/SharedFolder /mnt/shared_folder cifs username=user,password=pass1234,uid=1000,gid=1000,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0
Make sure to replace the username, password, uid, and gid with your own details.

Save and Exit

And try now reboot your machine and access to /mnt/shared_forder and see if you can see the folders/files shared, and add and delete this, and check if all this operation appear on the folder in the Windows machine
